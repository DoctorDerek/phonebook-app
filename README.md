# 🃏 Phonebook App - Next.js 13 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS + XState + CRUD Operations

# 👀 View Production Build at https://phonebook-app.vercel.app/

This is a simple phonebook app that supports CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).

The app provides a form where you can enter in first name, last name, and phone number for each phonebook entry.
